# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning–based system designed to **automatically identify plant diseases from leaf images**. The project leverages **computer vision and deep learning** techniques to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in detecting diseases early, enabling timely treatment and reducing crop loss.

---

## Problem Statement
Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity and food security. Traditional disease identification relies on manual inspection by experts, which is:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Not scalable for large farms or remote areas

An automated, image-based disease detection system can provide fast, accurate, and accessible diagnosis.

---

## Solution
Developed a **deep learning–based image classification system** that:
- Analyzes leaf images
- Identifies whether a plant is healthy or diseased
- Classifies the type of disease when present

The system uses a **trained convolutional neural network (CNN)** to extract visual patterns from plant leaves and make accurate predictions.
